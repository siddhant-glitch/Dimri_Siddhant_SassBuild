# SASS build system for a css operated file

## Description
Making an easy yet efficient sass framework for an already css driven html.
  
## Prerequisites
Requires SASS libraries.

Step by step:
Install Anywhere (Standalone)
You can install Sass on Windows, Mac, or Linux by downloading the package for your operating system from GitHub and adding it to your PATH. That’s all—there are no external dependencies and nothing else you need to install.
Install Anywhere (npm)
If you use Node.js, you can also install Sass using npm by running

npm install -g sass

## Using the build
After installing the package you will be able to further customize thee project based on the different library already sorted. For decompressed compiled sass use **sass --watch master.scss:custom.css --style compressed** in the terminal(**Mac**) or Git Bash(**PC**).
