# AJAX Build

## Plan
The idea of the Build is to populate data where required for eg. course name, professor name etc. using json file and by using Fetch API and building a framework with it.

## Path
Main idea was to locate the headers and paragraph tags and then add data into it using the Fetch API and then converting the readable json file to a javascript accesible file and then running the commands to add data from that file to the tags.

## Description
Making an easy yet efficient sass framework for an already css driven html.
  
## Prerequisites
Requires SASS libraries.

Step by step:
Install Anywhere (Standalone)
You can install Sass on Windows, Mac, or Linux by downloading the package for your operating system from GitHub and adding it to your PATH. That’s all—there are no external dependencies and nothing else you need to install.
Install Anywhere (npm)
If you use Node.js, you can also install Sass using npm by running

npm install -g sass

## Using the build
After installing the package you will be able to further customize thee project based on the different library already sorted. For decompressed compiled sass use **sass --watch master.scss:custom.css --style compressed** in the terminal(**Mac**) or Git Bash(**PC**).
